### Structure
The `docs` folder contains documents that contain theory or stuff I had to turn in.
The `processing` folder contains `python` scripts used to process the data in order to get some visualizations.
The `media` folder contains any static visualization (usually the output of any `processing` script)
The `datasets` folder contains the datasets used for every visualization
